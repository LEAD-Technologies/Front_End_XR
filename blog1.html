                    A lot has happened in the world of VR during the past few months, 
                    and the Oculus Quest 2 is now more powerful than everâ€”especially when you enhance it with game-changing accessories. 
                    When you have a gaming system that's this good, you have to ask yourself: Can you make it even better? 
                    You sure can if you consider adding any of these products we've identified as the best Oculus Quest 2 accessories available in 2022.
                    What's great about the Oculus Quest 2 (check out our review) is that it's inexpensive, 
                    easy to use, completely portable and able to play extremely immersive PC-caliber games. 
                    It's also great for experiencing VR-based workouts and other simulated activities, 
                    like playing golf or fishing. Whether you are looking for a more comfortable headset fit, 
                    a way to play PC VR games from Steam, accessories that'll make certain types of games even more realistic, 
                    or an easy option for making your controllers rechargeable, a vast selection of options are available right now. 
                    Check out this list of 15 Oculus Quest 2 accessories and discover exactly what's missing from your VR universe. 
                    Not everyone loves the audio built into the Oculus Quest 2. The speakers are weak and sound thin. 
                    In fact, almost any pair of headphones you plug into the VR headset's audio jack will sound better. 
                    But external headphones are clumsy and are not too comfortable when you're already wearing a VR headset.

                    There's a much better option in Logitech's aluminum-clad G333 VR gaming earphones. 
                    They're optimized specifically for the Quest 2. Not only do these earphones sound great, 
                    but thanks to the silicone-tipped earbuds, they help isolate you by blocking outside sounds and ambient noise. 
                    Their best feature, however, is that the wires for the left and right ear are ideal lengths to reach each side, 
                    so you don't have to contend with a lot of extra cabling getting in your way. 
                    Perhaps the Quest 2's most compelling feature is that you can use it both as a standalone all-in-one VR headset, 
                    but also connect it to a Windows PC to play PC VR games originally intended for other headsets, like the HTC Vive. 
                    All you need is a long Oculus Link-compatible USB cable. 
                    Well, you don't get more compatible than Oculus's own official cable. This 16-foot cable has a fiber optic core. 
                    It offers the bandwidth to play any PC VR game with your Quest 2 headset. 
                    That said, this cable requires a USB-C connection on your computer (it doesn't come with a USB-A adapter). 
                    Unfortunately, it's pretty expensive as well, but the added gaming experiences it allows are worth it.
